        So, when it’s safe to travel again, where will you go? 
            
        These adventure destinations are sure to inspire your next lockdown daydream session.

      <a href="https://www.backpackingmatt.com/about/"><h2>1. Hike Acatenango Volcano, Guatemala </h2></a>
        
        <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cD38FTkgUqib4mfJ5DH74gHaE8&pid=Api&P=0"width="100%" height="40%"><br><br>
        If you’ve ever wanted to get up close and personal with a live volcano, Guatemala is the place to do it. 
        Guatemala is home to 37 volcanoes, three of which are active and the rest dormant. Acatenango is the third-
        highest volcano in Guatemala, offering a challenging but achievable hike. 

        Reaching the summit takes around five hours, but it can also be done as an overnight hike with options to camp 
        out under the stars. From here you’ll see Acatenango’s crater and reach the best lookout point for viewing the 
        active Fuego Volcano, which is always putting on a show.

       <h2>2. Try Dog Sledding in Alaska</h2>

        Imagine speeding through snow-covered Alaskan Forest on a sled pulled by dogs. This Alaskan obsession can be 
        enjoyed as a one-day trip or multi-day adventure, with opportunities to see the vast Alaskan countryside, pet 
        the beloved sled dogs, and learn about the rich cultural heritage behind the sport.

        <h2>3. Snorkel with gentle giants at Ningaloo Reef, Australia</h2>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/76/b8/ff/76b8ff88d0427ca9c1bfd21758479d36.jpg"width="100%" height="40%"><br><br>
        The whale sharks of Ningaloo Reef are the biggest fish in the ocean. Living on a diet entirely of plankton, 
        there’s no need to fear these gentle giants. Between March and August, these amazing creatures migrate along 
        the coast, putting on a spectacular show for snorkelers.

        If you’re curious about sharks, but you’re not quite into cage diving with Great Whites, this adventure might 
        be right up your alley.

        <h2>4. Visit the cutest little capital in the world – Wellington, New Zealand</h2>
        <img src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qbt49mMYYTs_PTYr2J5_nwHaE8&pid=Api&P=0"width="100%" height="40%"><br><br>
         Fly to the corner of the world and visit the cutest little capital, Wellington City. Here you can get the full 
         mix of New Zealand’s natural, cultural, political and historical scene while trying some of the country’s best cuisine 
         and coffee. 

         Wander along the waterfront, visit parliament’s Beehive building, or discover New Zealand’s vibrant history at Te Papa 
        Museum. If you stay nearby you’ll also be able to visit the native wildlife at Zealandia Ecosanctuary, or see many of the 
        famous movie artefacts at Weta Workshop. With the smell of coffee filling the air and music bustling out from every shop, 
        the vibe is always good in Wellington.

        <img src="https://bikudotravel.com/media/x35irmuz/adobestock_245373533-1.jpeg"width="100%" height="40%"><br><br>
         Head to Northern Thailand to scale the canopies of the 1500-year old Chiang Mai Rainforest. Ziplining on a single-person 
        swing lets you glide along the Yang treetops, giving a bird’s eye view of the jungle below and making this a bucket list 
        activity for GoPro fanatics and rush-seekers. This activity offers the perfect adrenaline rush for solo travellers, groups 
        or families. See the wonders of the jungle including cliffs, rivers and the wonderful Chiang Mai wildlife.
